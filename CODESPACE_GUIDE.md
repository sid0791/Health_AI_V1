# HealthCoach AI - GitHub Codespace Setup Guide

Welcome to HealthCoach AI! This guide will help you run and test the complete
application in GitHub Codespaces for real-time user interaction and testing.

## üîí Firewall & Privacy Configuration

- **Firewall-Friendly**: No blocked connections to telemetry.nextjs.org
- **Privacy-First**: Your development activity remains completely private
- **Improved Setup**: Enhanced error handling and timeout prevention

For detailed information, see:
[TELEMETRY_FIREWALL_FIX.md](./TELEMETRY_FIREWALL_FIX.md)

**üîß Quick Verification**: Run `./verify-codespace.sh` to check your setup is
working correctly.

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Running with Real APIs

To test with real AI providers:

1. Edit `services/backend/.env`
2. Replace demo API keys with real ones:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-real-openai-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-real-anthropic-key
   ```
3. Set `USE_MOCK_AI_RESPONSES=false`
4. Restart the backend

### Custom Configuration

- Modify environment files in `services/backend/.env` and `apps/web/.env.local`
- Restart services to apply changes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Quick Verification

```bash
# Run the verification script to check your setup
./verify-codespace.sh
```

### Common Issues

#### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Kill processes using ports
pkill -f "next dev"
pkill -f "nest start"
```

#### Dependencies Issues

```bash
# Clear and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
```

#### Build Errors

```bash
# Clean build
pnpm run clean
pnpm run build
```

#### Setup Script Issues

```bash
# If codespace setup fails, try manual setup
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
./.devcontainer/setup.sh
```

#### Environment Issues

- Check `.env` files are created correctly
- Ensure no sensitive keys are committed (using demo keys only)
- Run `./verify-codespace.sh` to validate environment variables

### Getting Help

1. Run `./verify-codespace.sh` first for automated diagnostics
2. Check the console logs in browser developer tools
3. Review terminal output for error messages
4. Check if all ports are properly forwarded in Codespaces
5. Ensure the auto-setup script completed successfully

## üìä Performance Tips

- **Codespace specs**: Use 4-core or higher for best performance
- **Browser**: Chrome/Edge recommended for best compatibility
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for smooth AI interactions

## üîí Security Notes

- **Demo mode**: All API keys are placeholders for security
- **Production**: Never commit real API keys to the repository
- **Codespaces**: Automatically handles port security and access

## üìñ Additional Resources

- **Architecture**: See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical details
- **API Documentation**: Available at `http://localhost:8080/api/docs` when
  running
- **User Guide**: See `USER_GUIDE.md` for local development setup
